# Image Generation Flow - Logging Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

Added comprehensive `[IMAGE]` logging to trace the entire image generation and verification flow.

## 📋 Log Messages Added

### 1. Callback Receipt
```typescript
if (isImageOnly) {
  console.log('🖼️ [CALLBACK] Image-only callback detected (Seedream)');
  console.log('[IMAGE] Callback received for image generation');
}
```
**Logs when:** Image-only callback arrives from Seedream

### 2. Image Verification (Success)
```typescript
if (checked.width >= TARGET.width && checked.height >= TARGET.height) {
  console.log('[IMAGE] Verified:', `${checked.width}x${checked.height}`);
}
```
**Logs when:** Image meets 2048x1152 minimum requirement

### 3. Image Too Small - Regenerating
```typescript
console.log('[IMAGE] Skipped: URL invalid or too small, regenerating synchronously');
const regen = await generateImage(pending.extended_prompt_image);
```
**Logs when:** Image is < 2048x1152, regenerates with stored prompt

### 4. Image Too Small - No Regeneration
```typescript
console.log('[IMAGE] Skipped: URL invalid or too small, no prompt to regenerate');
```
**Logs when:** Image is too small but no prompt available for regeneration

### 5. No Image URL - Regenerating
```typescript
console.log('[IMAGE] Skipped: No image URL provided, regenerating synchronously');
const gen = await generateImage(pending.extended_prompt_image);
console.log('[IMAGE] Regenerating synchronously after missing image');
```
**Logs when:** No image URL in callback, generates new one synchronously

### 6. No Image URL - No Regeneration
```typescript
console.log('[IMAGE] Skipped: No image URL and no prompt to regenerate');
```
**Logs when:** No image URL and no stored prompt to use

### 7. Verification Failed
```typescript
console.log('[IMAGE] Skipped: URL invalid or too small, verification failed');
```
**Logs when:** Verification process throws an error

### 8. Generation Failed
```typescript
console.log('[IMAGE] Skipped: Generation failed');
```
**Logs when:** Synchronous regeneration throws an error

## 🔍 Flow Tracing

### Scenario A: Perfect Image in Callback
```
[IMAGE] Callback received for image generation
[IMAGE] Verified: 2048x1152
✅ Track saved with 2K image
```

### Scenario B: Image Too Small
```
[IMAGE] Callback received for image generation
[IMAGE] Skipped: URL invalid or too small, regenerating synchronously
🖼️ [SYNC IMAGE] Image verified at 2048x1152
✅ Track saved with regenerated 2K image
```

### Scenario C: No Image in Callback
```
(No image-only callback, audio callback arrives first)
[IMAGE] Skipped: No image URL provided, regenerating synchronously
🖼️ [SYNC IMAGE] Image verified at 2048x1152
✅ Track saved with generated 2K image
```

### Scenario D: Verification Fails
```
[IMAGE] Callback received for image generation
[IMAGE] Skipped: URL invalid or too small, verification failed
❌ Track saved with null image_url
```

### Scenario E: Generation Fails
```
[IMAGE] Skipped: No image URL provided, regenerating synchronously
[IMAGE] Skipped: Generation failed
❌ Track saved with null image_url
```

## 🎯 Current Architecture

### Synchronous Image Generation
- `generateImage()` removed `callBackUrl`, making it **fully synchronous**
- Images return immediately via Kie.ai API response
- No async callbacks for images (only for music)

### Verification Logic
- All images verified with `verifyAndUpscaleTo2K(imageUrl, { width: 2048, height: 1152 })`
- Only saves images that are ≥ 2048x1152
- Falls back to synchronous regeneration if image is too small

### Image-Only Callbacks
- Currently **not used** because `generateImage()` is synchronous
- Logging present for future async image support
- Would need `task_id` mapping to link image callbacks to music tracks

## 📊 Expected Logs

When generating a new track:

```
🔔 [CALLBACK] Received @ [timestamp]
📌 taskId: [id] status: complete completed? true
[IMAGE] Skipped: No image URL provided, regenerating synchronously
🖼️ [SYNC IMAGE] Model: bytedance/seedream-v4-text-to-image
🖼️ [SYNC IMAGE] Image verified at 2048x1152
[IMAGE] Regenerating synchronously after missing image
✅ [CALLBACK] Track updated for task_id: [id]
```
