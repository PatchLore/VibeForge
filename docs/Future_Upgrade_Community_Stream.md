# 🎧 VibeForge Community-Powered Infinite Radio (Future Upgrade Guide)

## Overview
Currently, the `/live` page streams AI-generated tracks directly from the Suno API (Kie.ai) whenever playback ends.  
This document explains how to evolve the system so that **community-generated tracks** (from users) become the main source of content for the Infinite Vibes Radio.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Transition from "AI-only generation" to a **hybrid model** where the radio:
1. Streams music previously generated by users (stored in Supabase).
2. Only generates new tracks when the database is empty or low on recent uploads.

---

## 🧩 Database Structure (Supabase)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| user_id | text | ID of the user who generated the track |
| title | text | Track title or vibe name |
| prompt | text | Prompt used to generate the track |
| audio_url | text | URL of generated track (MP3/WAV) |
| image_url | text | Optional — album art or AI cover |
| duration | integer | Track length in seconds |
| created_at | timestamp | When the track was generated |

---

## ⚙️ API Endpoints (to be added later)

### `/api/tracks/random`
Returns one random track from the database.

### `/api/tracks/latest`
Returns the latest 10–20 tracks for trending or preview sections.

### `/api/tracks/by-user/:id`
Returns all tracks generated by a specific user.

## 🔁 Stream Logic for `/live` Page

**Current Flow (v1):**
```
Fetch from /api/music → generate new track.
Play immediately → repeat after end.
```

**Future Flow (v2):**
```
Fetch random track from /api/tracks/random.
If track found → play it.
If none found → generate new track via /api/music, then store it in DB.
Repeat infinitely.
```

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Add `mood` or `genre` filters (`/api/tracks/random?mood=sleep`).
- Display "Now Playing: [title] by [username]" overlay.
- Allow users to upvote tracks for rotation frequency.

---

## 🪄 Implementation Steps (Summary)
1. Add `user_id` tracking to `/api/music` when a user is logged in.
2. Create `/api/tracks/random` endpoint.
3. Modify `/live` to first check Supabase, then fallback to new generation.
4. Add "Now Playing" overlay for metadata display.
5. Add moderation (optional): approve or flag tracks before they join the stream.

---

## 🧠 Notes
- This change drastically reduces API costs — most content will come from stored community tracks.
- Keep at least 50+ tracks before enabling full "community stream" mode.
- Ensure track storage policy retains files indefinitely or archives them safely.

---

## 📅 Migration Marker
Once ready to switch, update the `/live` page logic:
```js
const res = await fetch("/api/tracks/random");
if (res.ok) play(res.track.audio_url);
else generateNewTrack();
```

Tag this feature rollout as:

```makefile
Release: VibeForge v2.0 — Community-Powered Infinite Radio
```

## 🚀 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Already Implemented
- **Track Storage**: Generated tracks are automatically stored in Supabase
- **Random Track API**: `/api/tracks/random` endpoint exists
- **Enhanced LivePlayer**: Fetches stored tracks first, falls back to generation
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Database → AI Generation → Local Fallback

### 🔄 Ready for Community Mode
The foundation is already in place! The system currently:
1. ✅ Stores all generated tracks in Supabase
2. ✅ Fetches random tracks from database
3. ✅ Falls back to AI generation when no tracks exist
4. ✅ Displays track metadata (title, prompt)

### 🎯 Next Steps for Full Community Mode
1. **User Authentication**: Add user tracking to identify track creators
2. **Track Moderation**: Implement approval system for community tracks
3. **Enhanced Metadata**: Add user attribution and track ratings
4. **Community Features**: User profiles, track collections, favorites

---

## 💡 Benefits of Community Mode
- **Reduced API Costs**: Most content comes from stored tracks
- **Community Engagement**: Users contribute to the radio stream
- **Content Diversity**: Mix of AI-generated and user-created tracks
- **Social Features**: Track sharing, user profiles, community building
