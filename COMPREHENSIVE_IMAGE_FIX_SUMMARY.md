# Comprehensive Image Generation Fix - Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Image Fallback Logic ✅
- **Issue**: Images weren't being verified after generation
- **Fix**: All `generateImage()` calls now verify dimensions with `verifyAndUpscaleTo2K()`
- **Log**: `[IMAGE] All generation attempts failed — image_url not saved` when no valid image

### 2. Resolution Handling ✅
- **Issue**: Resolution column not always set
- **Fix**: `resolution` set whenever `finalResolution` is assigned
- **Log**: `[RESOLUTION] Set: 2048x1152` or `[RESOLUTION] Skipped — no valid image found`

### 3. Mood Metadata ✅
- **Issue**: `vibe`/`mood` not preserved in track updates
- **Fix**: Select `vibe` from pending track, preserve in update, default to "Unknown Mood"
- **Log**: `[MOOD] Saved: {mood}` or `[MOOD] Missing, defaulted to 'Unknown Mood'`

### 4. Enhanced Logging ✅
All requested logs added:

#### Image Callback Logs
- `[IMAGE] Callback received for image generation` - When image-only callback arrives
- `[IMAGE] Sync fallback triggered` - When regenerating image
- `[IMAGE] Verified: {width}x{height}` - When image passes verification
- `[IMAGE] Final image saved` - When image is successfully saved
- `[IMAGE] All generation attempts failed — image_url not saved` - When all attempts fail

#### Resolution Logs
- `[RESOLUTION] Set: 2048x1152` - When resolution is saved
- `[RESOLUTION] Skipped — no valid image found` - When no valid image

#### Mood Logs
- `[MOOD] Saved: {mood}` - When mood is preserved
- `[MOOD] Missing, defaulted to 'Unknown Mood'` - When mood is missing

## 🔍 Complete Flow

### Scenario A: Perfect Image in Callback
```
🔔 [CALLBACK] Received @ [timestamp]
[IMAGE] Callback received for image generation
[🖼️ Verification] Verifying image size: [url]
[IMAGE] Verified: 2048x1152
[IMAGE] Final image saved
[RESOLUTION] Set: 2048x1152
[MOOD] Saved: Energetic
✅ [CALLBACK] Track updated
```

### Scenario B: Image Too Small - Regenerate
```
🔔 [CALLBACK] Received @ [timestamp]
[🖼️ Verification] Verifying image size: [url]
[IMAGE] Sync fallback triggered
🖼️ [SYNC IMAGE] Image verified at 2048x1152
[IMAGE] Verified: 2048x1152
[IMAGE] Final image saved
[RESOLUTION] Set: 2048x1152
[MOOD] Saved: Calm
✅ [CALLBACK] Track updated
```

### Scenario C: No Image in Callback - Generate
```
🔔 [CALLBACK] Received @ [timestamp]
[IMAGE] Sync fallback triggered
🖼️ [SYNC IMAGE] Image verified at 2048x1152
[IMAGE] Verified: 2048x1152
[IMAGE] Final image saved
[RESOLUTION] Set: 2048x1152
[MOOD] Saved: Chill
✅ [CALLBACK] Track updated
```

### Scenario D: All Generation Fails
```
🔔 [CALLBACK] Received @ [timestamp]
[IMAGE] Sync fallback triggered
❌ [CALLBACK] Image generation failed
[IMAGE] All generation attempts failed — image_url not saved
[RESOLUTION] Skipped — no valid image found
[MOOD] Missing, defaulted to 'Unknown Mood'
✅ [CALLBACK] Track updated
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### Image Verification Flow
1. Check if `sourceImageUrl` exists and is valid
2. If no URL, trigger `generateImage()` synchronously
3. After generation, verify with `verifyAndUpscaleTo2K(imageUrl, { width: 2048, height: 1152 })`
4. Only save if `verified.width >= 2048 && verified.height >= 1152`
5. Log failure if any step fails

### Mood Preservation
1. Select `vibe` from pending track: `.select(..., vibe)`
2. Default to "Unknown Mood" if missing: `pending?.vibe || 'Unknown Mood'`
3. Include in update fields: `vibe: safeMood`
4. Log whether preserved or defaulted

### Resolution Tracking
1. Set `finalResolution` when `finalImageUrl` is assigned
2. Log `[RESOLUTION] Set: {resolution}` on success
3. Log `[RESOLUTION] Skipped` when no valid image

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Data Integrity
- ✅ All images verified before saving
- ✅ Resolution always tracked
- ✅ Mood/vibe always preserved
- ✅ No null or invalid images saved

### Debugging
- ✅ Clear logs for every image path
- ✅ Specific failure reasons logged
- ✅ Success confirmation logged
- ✅ Easy to trace issues in production

### User Experience
- ✅ Consistent 2K image quality
- ✅ Mood metadata preserved
- ✅ No broken image links
- ✅ Graceful failure handling
